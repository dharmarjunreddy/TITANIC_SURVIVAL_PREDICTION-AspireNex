# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic would survive the disaster based on various features such as age, sex, ticket class, and more. The project explores data preprocessing, feature engineering, and several machine learning models to achieve the best prediction accuracy.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. It contains information about the passengers, such as:

• **PassengerId:** Unique ID for each passenger

• **Survived:** Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

• **Pclass:** Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)

• **Name:** Name of the passenger

• **Sex:** Sex of the passenger

• **Age:** Age of the passenger

• **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic

• **Parch:** Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic

• **Ticket:** Ticket number

• **Fare:** Passenger fare

• **Cabin:** Cabin number

• **Embarked:** Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

# Modeling Process
**1. Data Exploration:** Understanding the data using visualizations and descriptive statistics.

**2. Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values and outliers.

**3. Feature Engineering:** Creating new features and transforming existing ones.

**4. Model Training:** Training various machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and more.

**5. Model Evaluation:** Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

# Results
The top-performing model achieved an accuracy of 80% on the test set. Further enhancements could involve tuning hyperparameters, incorporating additional features, or leveraging more advanced models to improve predictive performance.
